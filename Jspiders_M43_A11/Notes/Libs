
java.lang

* It contains all the classes which are essential
  to write simple java program or to develop
  complicated java applications.
  
* To use classes of java.lang package we need not
  write any import statement of fully qualified class names.
  
  
Object class

* Object is super-most class in java
* Each and every class directly or indirectly inherits from object class

  methods of Object class
  
  -hashCode() 
  -toString()
  -equals()
  
  -wait()
  -wait(long)
  -wait(long,int)  } --> Threads
  -notify()
  -notifyAll()
  -clone()     --> Object clonning
  -getClass()  
  -finalize()  --> Garabage collection
  
  
  
  
  
  
   	hashCode()
    * Returns a hash code value for the object.
    * hash code value of an object is an unique integer value 
      which is generated by the jvm based on the address of the given
      object.
    
    toString()
    * Returns string representation of the Object
    * String representation contains
     
      *Fully qualified class name
      *@ character
      *hexadecimal value of hashCode
      
      
       * If you print the reference variable then println()
      will implicitly call the toString() and prints
      returned value.
  
    equals(anotherobject)
    * it compares the hashcode value of given 2 objects and returns true
      if they are same else it returns false.
