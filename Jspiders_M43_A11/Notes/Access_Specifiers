A java package is group of classes and interfaces which are related to one single module in the given project.

Package naming convention

package name is always written in all-lowercase.

package names are always written in reverse order of domain

 convention 1
  domain.appname.modulename
  com.gmail.inbox  

  convention 2

A class name which is written with its package 
name is called as fully qualified class name.
