  and grant the access through getter and setter methods.
  
* Encapsulation is used to provide security for data members
  against the invalid values.

* getter method returns the current value of the data member

* return type of getter method depends on the data type
  of the data member who's value will be returned 
  
* setter method updates the value of the data member.

* return type of setter method will be usually void because
  it does'nt return any value.
